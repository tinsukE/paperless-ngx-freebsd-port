paperless-ngx needs the following services to run:
- paperless_webserverd: the web app
- paperless_schedulerd: the celery beat, dispatches async workers on a timely fashion
- paperless_taskqueued: the celery async workers, used for processing files, training AI classifiers, etc
- paperless_consumerd: the consumption task, optional. It consumes/imports files from the consumption path

Configure them to start automatically by running:
sysrc paperless_webserverd=YES
sysrc paperless_schedulerd=YES
sysrc paperless_taskqueued=YES
sysrc paperless_consumerd=YES

Create a user by running:
%%OPTDIR%%/setup/setup_user.sh
(otherwise a default user with name/password admin/admin will be created at the first time paperless_webserverd is started)

The configuration file can be found at:
%%OPTDIR%%/paperless.conf

The settings are explained here:
https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/

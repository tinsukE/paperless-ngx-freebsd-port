Paperless-ngx is a community-supported open-source document management system
that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you
can keep, well, less paper.

Paper is a nightmare. Environmental issues aside, there's no excuse for it in
the 21st century. It takes up space, collects dust, doesn't support any form of
a search feature, indexing is tedious, it's heavy and prone to damage & loss.

This software is designed to make "going paperless" easier. No more worrying
about finding stuff again, feed documents right from the post box into the
scanner and then shred them. Perhaps you might find it useful too.
